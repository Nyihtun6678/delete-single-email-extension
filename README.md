# Delete Key for Gmail™

## Introduction

Google's Gmail™ has allowed a keyboard shortcut to delete entire message threads (#) for a long time, but it has never made it possible to use a keyboard shortcut to delete individual emails in threads.

Until now.

Enter Delete Key for Gmail™. Press `Shift + 5` (`%` symbol), and voila - only the current individual message is deleted. It performs the same action as clicking the menu button on a message and selecting "Delete this message."

The best part is you can change this shortcut to anything you want from the extension's Options page.

## Installation
